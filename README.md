CS Assignment: Create a pizza ordering "form"

The assignment was to create a form but the main "learning objective" was to play with GUI in Python using any library (tkinter, pygame, etc.)

**created with python3(languge), pycharm(IDE), and pygame(library)**
**REQUIRES PYTHON3 AND PYGAME TO LAUNCH (or if you launch the project in pycharm pygame will automatically work within the project without you installing it)**
